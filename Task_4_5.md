# Tasks 4 and 5  
Created a branch called Temp, used the checkout command to switch branches, created a markdown file for Task 3, then pushed that.  

Then switched to main and merged temp, then created a .md for Tasks 4 and 5 and pushed that.

```git checkout -b Temp   

touch Task_3.md

git add .  

git commit -m 

git push -u origin Temp 

git checkout main  

git merge Temp  

touch Task_4_5.md

git add .  

git commit -m "final commit"  

git push -u origin main```
